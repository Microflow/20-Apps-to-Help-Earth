<h2 align="center">The Real Farmville</h2>

<i>Matthew and their friends pay 5 dollars each and raise 100USD. It's Sunday morning. He wants to donate to a farm in Mexico City. They will grow 200 cherry tomatoes in a bed with his friend's name on it. They can log on and see the seeds grow every day. The famer takes a timelapse 4 times per day on a smartphone. He can check the crops progress on a timelapsed review. When the tomatos are grown, the farmer's wife makes them into burritos and gives 50 out to local kids. They film the party, say thanks to Matthew + friends, and put the video online.</i>

<h3>Open Source Strategy Chess</h3>

Shanghai Vs Beijing! Teams, Towns and whole cities play against each other. Moves are discussed openly, publically. White and Black teams discuss a move, and the entire team crowdvotes the winning move, and strategy. <i>How does it affect your strategy if you know the other team is monitoring all your communications?</i> A whole meta-game is created around the game.

Can you trust everyone in your ranks? How do you know you don't have enemy agents trying to trick you into a false move?

In Byzantine Chess, <b>double-agents are permitted.</b> Can you trust everyone in your camp?

Inspired partially by Jorge Luis Borges's "The Babylon Lottery", and the Byzantine General Problem. 

(Babylon Lottery Quote) 

<h3>Street Fighter Chess: Endgame</h3>

There can be only two...

Tournament: 100 players are thrust into endgame problems against each other in a sudden death knockout tournament. Only one player wins.

Prize fund goes to crowdfunding project of their choice. 75 percent to first place, 25 percent to second.

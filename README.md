<h2 align="center">Buy Some Give One Marketplace</h2>

<b>Weaving giving into everyday life</b>

<i>User story, Buyer: Maria logs on to Buy Some Give One because she knows that every time 10-20 items are bought, one is given away. For every 10 Ukulele's sold, one is given to a schoolkid. For every 20 packets of spaghetti sold, one pack is given to a homeless shelter. For every 15 shirts sold, one is given to a homeless person. No tax, no tithing, just giving. How do merchants save on postage costs? Simple. They don't send physical goods, just partner up with another store, and send enough money to buy one product.

Example: John's Ukulele store in Tennessee, pledges to give away 1 Uke for every 10 sold. Once ten are sold, John Paypals 65USD to Macy's Uke store in East Village, who give away one Uke, courtesy John's. Macy can also have a similar deal going on with another store.

Instead of wasting money on advertising, John's general store can pay 5 dollars a month for a pitch on Buy Some Give One, and give away an item for every X items sold. Simple, easy, beats renting billboard space.

<br><br>

<h2 align="center">65% Donation App</h2>

Crowdfunding, for when you already have more than half the money saved. 

<i>User story: Jim wants to refit his living room. He has enough for paint, chairs and carpet, but needs 350USD for a new sofa. He puts 650 into the fund himself. Can his friends and family help raise the other 350USD?</i>

<h2 align="center">Gamifying Crowdfunding- Tron-funding</h2>

<b>Proof of Concept for Gamified Crowdfunding</b>

<i>User story: Bob plays Alice over a remote connection. Each has a crowdfunding project at stake. Bob wants to fund filters in Peru. Alice wants to fund a clothing stall in NYC. The crowd fill the progress bars of each project. The winner of 5 rounds of Tron takes 75 %, the loser 25%</i>

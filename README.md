<h2 align="center">Buy Some Give One Marketplace: Forward Now</h2>

<i>This can be prototyped on Shopify.</i>

<b>Weaving giving into everyday life</b>

No tax, no tithing, just giving.

<i>User story, Buyer: Maria logs on to Buy Some Give One. She knows that every time 10-20 items are bought, one is given away. For every 10 Ukulele's sold, one is given to a schoolkid. For every 20 packets of organic pasta sold, one pack is given to a homeless shelter. For every 15 hemp shirts sold, one is given to a charity in Peru.  How do merchants save on postage costs? Simple. They don't send physical goods. They just partner up with another store, and Paypal enough money to buy one product.

Example: John's Ukulele store in Tennessee, pledges to give away 1 Uke for every 10 sold. Once ten are sold, John Paypals 65 USD to Macy's Uke store in East Village, who give away one maplewood Uke, courtesy John's of Tennessee. Macy can also have a similar deal going on with another store. For every 20 Flamenco guitars sold, Macy's of East Village will give one away to a youth center in Queens. 

Instead of wasting money on advertising, John's general store can pay 10 dollars a month for a pitch on Buy Some Give One, and give away an item for every X items sold. 

<strong>Buy One Give One</strong> is an unworkable business model. Companies can't afford to give away one product for every one sold. Buy some give one works. Companies can save money on advertising, and instead give things forward. 

Simple, easy, fair. It beats renting billboard space.

We're building a timeline where every product sold adds up to a gift for someone, somewhere. 

We prefer organic food, musical instruments, herbs and nutritional products, helpful gadgets... anything that can build a better world. 

<h2 align="center">The Real Farmville</h2>

<i>Matthew and their friends pay 5 dollars each and raise 100USD. It's Sunday morning. He wants to donate to a farm in Mexico City. They will grow 200 cherry tomatoes in a bed with his friend's name on it. They can log on and see the seeds grow every day. The famer takes a timelapse 4 times per day on a smartphone. He can check the crops progress on a timelapsed review. When the tomatos are grown, the farmer's wife makes them into burritos and gives 50 out to local kids. They film the party, say thanks to Matthew + friends, and put the video online.</i>

Crowdfunding, for when you already have more than half the money saved. 

<i>User story: Jim wants to refit his living room. He has enough for paint, chairs and carpet, but needs 350USD for a new sofa. He puts 650 into the fund himself. Can his friends and family help raise the other 350USD?</i>

<h2 id="#LightBikes" align="center">Gamifying Crowdfunding- Tron-funding</h2>

<b>Proof of Concept for Gamified Crowdfunding</b>

<strong>Tron Funding: Twitch meets Start Some Good</strong>

<i>User story: Bob plays Alice over a remote connection. Both of them have a crowdfunding project they wish to fund. Bob wants 100 USD to fund water filters in Peru. Alice wants 100 USD to fund a home barleygrass farm in NYC. 100 people are watching them play Tron, or another simple browser game. The crowd donate 3-5 dollars each, and fill the prize fund to 300USD. The winner of 5 rounds of Tron takes home 200USD, second place 100USD. Alice wins! The web app pays out 200USD to her account, and 100USD to Bob.

After calculating the winner, the result goes to an admin panel for manual approval. No payment is made without

No pointless projects!

We prefer projects based on water filtration, organic food, industrial hemp...

</i>

<i>After the payment sytem was built, this could work with anything</i>

<h3>Open Source Strategy Chess</h3>

Shanghai Vs Beijing! Teams, Towns and whole cities play against each other. Moves are discussed openly, publically. White and Black teams discuss a move, and the entire team crowdvotes the winning move, and strategy. <i>How does it affect your strategy if you know the other team is monitoring all your communications?</i> A whole meta-game is created around the game.

Can you trust everyone in your ranks? How do you know you don't have enemy agents trying to trick you into a false move?

In Byzantine Chess, <b>double-agents are permitted.</b> Can you trust everyone in your camp?

Inspired partially by Jorge Luis Borges's "The Babylon Lottery", and the Byzantine General Problem. 

(Babylon Lottery Quote) 

<h3>Street Fighter Chess: Endgame</h3>

There can be only two...

Tournament: 100 players are thrust into endgame problems against each other in a sudden death knockout tournament. Only one player wins.

Prize fund goes to crowdfunding project of their choice. 75 percent to first place, 25 percent to second. 

*

<h3>Horde Chess</h3>

5 seconds per move. If you don't move in 5 seconds, you don't get to move. 

2 huge armies. 5 times the size of regular armies.

Variant I: Move 3 moves at a time. 10 second limit on moves. 

Varient II: 5 generals on each army. 

Varient III: Hills and Blockades. Some squares are blocked. 


<h3>AI vs AI Byzantine Chess</h3>

<strong>Benefits</strong>

- Large funds raised for useful projects. 
- Renewed interest in programming.
- New innovations for open source chess. 
- Group discussion of AI moves instead of humans blindly playing them.
- Pits programming languages and university teams against each other. 
- Adds a metagame to the game of chess.
- AI must explain its moves and thinking ahead of time.
- Allows discussion of programming language strengths and benefits.
- Mirrors modern warfare where both sides can monitor enemy communication.
